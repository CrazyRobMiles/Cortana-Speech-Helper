Cortana Speech Helper
=====================

This set of classes makes it easy to create programs that respond to single and two word commands that are issued to Cortana. It builds the Voice Command files that are used to decode the spoken text and also decodes incoming commands and resolves them into method calls in your program. There is an accompanying document and sample program.

You can use the classes to make voice controlled adventure games or simple voice controlled applications.

Enjoy
